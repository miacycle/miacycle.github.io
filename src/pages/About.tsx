          As a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Sydney and an Open Source Software Engineer, 
          I'm passionate about contributing to innovative technology solutions. 
          At USyd, I'm collaborating on a grant from the Australian Research Council (ARC). But, would like to consider
          an interdisciplinary research approach where I can allow my love of cycling to intersecting with urban data analytics or smart city tech.
          I'm a maintainer for Meshery, where I help develop and improve cloud native infrastructure management.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          When I'm not coding or researching, you can find me cycling around the beautiful city of Sydney, 
          exploring new trails and enjoying the outdoor lifestyle that Australia has to offer.
